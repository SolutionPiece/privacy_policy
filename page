## Welcome

Welcome to Solution Piece, where your privacy is our priority. We understand the importance of safeguarding your information and are committed to ensuring a transparent and secure experience for our users. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines how we handle your data when you use our mobile applications across all platforms (the “Application,” “Apps,” or “Applications”), the related services we provide (“Services”), and the Site.

We've crafted this Policy to shed light on our privacy practices, providing you with insights into the collection, use, and disclosure of information within our Applications, Services, and Site.

## 1. CONSENT AND MODIFICATION

Your use of the Services implies consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any part of this Policy, we kindly ask you not to access or use the Services. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, or otherwise adjust this Policy. The most recent version is available at [Your Privacy Policy URL], with the date of last modification mentioned above. Changes become effective fifteen (15) days after posting the revised Privacy Policy on the App or the Site. Continued use of the Services after this period implies acceptance of those changes. Please be aware that our employees or agents do not have the authority to alter any of our Policies.

## 2. WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

At Solution Piece, we do not collect any Personal Information when you use our Applications, Services, and/or Site. "Personal Information" refers to information that identifies you or another person. It may be transmitted or received when you use an Application, the Services, and/or the Site. Personal Information includes geographic location information, names, physical addresses, email addresses, telephone, fax and other device numbers, social security numbers, calendar entries, contact entries, files, content, photographs, location information, and other metadata in photographs and other information you transmit or receive using our Applications, Services, and/or Site that identifies you or another person. Personal Information also covers information about you or others accessed by our system directly from your Device, including from your address book, location, photos, or contacts folder, to enable certain features of an Application or the Services, such as finding and suggesting mutual friends and other individuals. Unless you opt-out of providing your geographic location information, the Applications may use and store information related to the geographic location of your device and combine this information with other Personal Information to provide certain services, whether or not the Application is active.

## 3. USER PERMISSIONS for MOBILE APPS

Some platforms may require user permissions for accessing specific Personal Information for our Mobile Applications. We may ask users to allow these permissions to enable certain features. As previously mentioned, Solution Piece does not collect any Personal Information from our users.

## 4. THIRD-PARTY SITES / ADVERTISEMENTS

Our Applications, Services, and Site access third-party information through application interfaces. Advertisements from other companies may be present within the Application, the Services, and/or the Site. Clicking on links of third parties may redirect you from the Application, the Services, or the Site. This Policy does not cover, and we are not responsible for, the privacy practices of third-party websites. Whether linked to or accessible from an Application, the Services, or the Site, the inclusion of a link or accessibility of third-party websites does not imply endorsement by us.

We are not liable for the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information by any third parties.

## 5. USERS WITH WHOM YOU SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

We have no control over the actions of other Users with whom you share your information. We cannot control the information you share with other Users using an Application, the Services, or the Site (including via Forums) or how such other Users will use or share such information. We are not responsible for third-party circumvention of our security measures.

## 6. SECURITY

Ensuring the confidentiality of your information is a top priority for Solution Piece. We take concrete steps to protect your privacy. However, please be aware that no security measures we take are absolutely guaranteed to prevent unauthorized access or use of your Personal / Non-Personal Information.

## 7. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

We do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your affirmative agreement.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 allows California residents to request specific information regarding the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
